In all cases, clear trend shows that the collision chance increases when road-alignment getting better, due to higher speed and less caution.  Except the unknown or \"other\" conditions, we can see in each cases:\n","1. most collision for one car accident is hitting a static object, followed closely by right and left roll on to shoulder.\n","2. for two car in same direction, most accidents are rear-end collision, which clearly increase along road-alignment.\n","3. for two car in different direction, right-angle collision is huge, guess is in intersection.  Left turn also post a lot risk, but right-turn is very low, even lower than head-on collision.  This may be a result of the inherent complexity of left turn.\n","\n","### Conclusion from Road Alignment analysis:\n","From all test performed above, we have following observations:\n","1. Most collisions happened in level and aligned road.  Drivers should pay more attention when drive on good road condition, and follow speed limit.\n","2. However, bad road alignment may post higher risk of fatal accident.  Drivers need to anticipate possible outcome when the view is not so wide, and always be cautious to avoid serious injury as possible.\n","3. Rear-end collision is the most popular collision type.  Keep enough space to the car in front of you, especially on well aligned road.\n","4. Right-angle collision and left-turn collision are also popular, wait one more second before turning your wheel, or rushing into the intersection."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"20c50e64-35c7-4625-bfde-02451b542e36","_uuid":"781d42437ebbcbf48b3a00d25e6852a089686370"},"source":["---\n","### 5 Vehicle
